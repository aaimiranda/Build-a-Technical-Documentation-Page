          <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:</p>
            <li>new or worsening cough</li>
            <li>shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>equal to or over 38°C</li> 
            <li>feverish</li> 
            <li>chills</li>
            <li>fatigue or weakness</li>
            <li>muscle or body aches</li>
            <li>new loss of smell or taste</li>
            <li>headache</li>
            <li>gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)</li>
            <li>feeling very unwell</li>
            <br>      
          <p>Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.
            In severe cases, infection can lead to death.
            Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.
            Evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:</p>
          <li>have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)</li>
          <li>never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)</li>
          <p>While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.</p>

          <p>Everyone should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Measures to reduce COVID-19 in your community are especially important as some areas begin to lift restrictions.
          In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within communities and across the country, all Canadians are advised to:
            <li>avoid closed spaces, crowded places, and close contact</li>
            <li>stay home and away from others if you feel sick</li>
            <li>stick to a small and consistent social circle and avoid gathering in large groups</li>
            <li>talk to your employer about working at home if possible</li>
            <li>limit contact with people at higher risk, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems</li>
            <li>go outside to exercise</li>
            <li>keep a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others</li>
            <li>household contacts (people you live with) don't need to distance from each other unless they're sick or have travelled in the last 14 days</li>

          <p>The status of the COVID-19 pandemic varies across country.</p>
          <p>Nationally, we’re seeing positive change from our actions. Public health measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 across country are flattening the curve and slowing the spread of new cases.</p>
          <p>The effects of COVID-19 vary between and within provinces and territories. Because of that, local governments, working with local public health authorities, may lift or change public health measures at different times depending on where you live.</p>
          <p>Your local government will:</p>
            <li>make decisions based on the local situation and the best evidence available at the time</li>
            <li>tailor plans for lifting measures to their regions, including remote and isolated communities</li>
            <li>gradually lift measures, allowing enough time between each step to assess the impact and adjust their plan, if required</li>
            <li>monitor the effectiveness, harms and benefits of specific measures, and then adjust less effective measures as needed</li>
          <p>National, provincial and local governments will continue public health efforts to minimize:</p>
            <li>serious illness and death</li>
            <li>disruptions in our society</li>
            <li>the burden on health care resources</li>

        <p>Health professionals in Canada have a critical role to play in identifying, reporting and managing potential cases of COVID-19.
        COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a new virus that was first recognized in December 2019. Genetic sequencing of the virus suggests that it is a betacoronavirus closely linked to the SARS virus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some can infect animals, and some can infect humans.</p>
        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020.</p>
        <p>Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. Symptoms of COVID-19 are often similar to other illnesses. They may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus. Recent studies indicate that transmission of the virus can happen from infected people before they develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic transmission) and from infected people who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic transmission). That is why everyone, even those who feel well, should follow measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
        <p>In severe cases, infection can lead to death.</p>
        <p>The WHO is actively monitoring the situation and has issued updated information on the outbreak, advice on public health measures and infection prevention and control, and enhanced surveillance.</p>
        <p>The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely and providing updates as new information becomes available.</p>
